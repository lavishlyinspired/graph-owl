# 00l — Build vs Adopt

**Status**: standing reference. Binds every engine epic.
**Verified against crates.io and the projects' own repositories on 28 July 2026.**

## The question this answers

"Why write a SPARQL engine, a reasoner and an RDF layer when libraries exist?"

It is the right question and it did not previously have a written answer, which
meant each epic implicitly answered it again. The short version:

> **Adopt everything above the storage line. Build everything below it.**

The line is not aesthetic. It is where this project's three differentiators
live, and every library surveyed sits on the wrong side of it for those three
things and the right side for everything else.

## What is actually available

Checked, with licences, because this project's `cargo deny` allowlist is
permissive-only (MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD, ISC, Unicode, Zlib) and **copyleft is
rejected by default** (`00i`).

### Rust

| Crate | Licence | Does | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| `spargebra` | Apache-2.0 / MIT | Full SPARQL 1.1 + 1.2 parser → standard algebra | **Adopt** — `07` decision 8 |
| `oxrdf`, `oxttl`, `oxjsonld` | Apache-2.0 / MIT | RDF terms, Turtle/N-Triples, JSON-LD | **Adopt** — Epic 9 |
| `oxsdatatypes` | Apache-2.0 / MIT | XSD datatypes | **Adopt** where `FlakeValue` needs XSD semantics |
| `reasonable` | BSD-3-Clause | OWL 2 RL via Datalog, *subset* of rules, Python bindings | **Evaluate** — see below |
| `whelk-rs` | BSD-3-Clause | **OWL EL reasoner** | **Evaluate seriously** — Epic 98 |
| `oxigraph` | Apache-2.0 / MIT | Complete store + SPARQL engine | **Test oracle only** — owns storage |
| `horned-owl` | **LGPL-3.0 / GPL-3.0** | OWL parsing and manipulation, 4 syntaxes | **Rejected by policy.** Would impose its terms on the binary |

### Python

`00j` puts Python out of process, so nothing here can be a library dependency —
only a separate service or an offline tool.

| Library | Licence | Does |
|---|---|---|
| `rdflib` | W3C Software (permissive) | RDF + SPARQL, mature, slow |
| `pySHACL` | Apache-2.0 | SHACL validation |
| `OWL-RL` | W3C Software | OWL 2 RL over rdflib |
| `owlready2` | **LGPL-3** | OWL + bundled HermiT (DL reasoning) |

**Python's real use here is not runtime.** It is offline conformance checking:
run the same ontology through `OWL-RL` or `owlready2` and diff against
graph-owl's derivations. That is a test asset, and a licence that would be a
problem in the binary is not a problem in a test script that ships to nobody.

## The storage line, precisely

Every library above takes *a graph* and returns *a graph* or *results*. That is
the correct design for a library and it is exactly why none can carry this
project's differentiators:

| Differentiator | Why a library cannot provide it |
|---|---|
| **Time travel** | `as_of` filters `t` **during the scan**. A library handed a materialised graph has already lost the time dimension — it received one state, not a history |
| **Authorization** | The access predicate compiles **into** the scan (Epic 13). A library handed a graph receives it unfiltered, and filtering results afterwards is precisely the leak Demo 2 exists to demonstrate is closed |
| **Explainability** | Epic 6 requires derivation chains. `reasonable` returns triples; the chain that produced them is not in its output |

So the split is:

```
  ADOPT   parse · RDF terms · serialize · algebra · reasoning algorithms
  ─────────────────── the storage line ───────────────────
  BUILD   flake scan · as_of · access predicate · derivation chains · budgets
```

## The pattern that lets us adopt reasoners anyway

The line above looks like it rules out `reasonable` and `whelk-rs`. It does not,
because of the order of operations:

1. graph-owl resolves flakes into a plain fact set, **applying `as_of` and the
   access predicate first**.
2. That already-filtered fact set goes to the library.
3. Derived facts come back into the overlay.

The library never sees what the caller may not see, and never sees a state other
than the one asked for — because the filtering happened *before* it was called.
Its lack of time-travel and authorization stops mattering.

**What is still lost: explanations.** `reasonable` returns facts, not chains,
and Epic 6 requires chains. Three options, and the third is what this project
should do:

| Option | Cost |
|---|---|
| Adopt, drop explanations | Loses a stated differentiator. No |
| Build everything | Slow, and re-implements a well-tested rule set |
| **Adopt for bulk, re-derive for explanation** | Materialise with the library; when someone asks *why* a specific fact holds, re-derive that one fact locally with tracking on |

The third works because explanation is **rare and single-fact** while
materialisation is **constant and whole-graph**. Optimising them separately is
correct rather than a compromise: a chain is needed for one fact at a time, at
human speed.

## Decisions

1. **No parser is written for a standard we did not invent.** SPARQL, Turtle,
   JSON-LD, XSD all have permissive Rust parsers.
2. **A copyleft dependency is rejected regardless of quality.** `horned-owl` is
   the best OWL manipulation library in Rust and is LGPL/GPL. It does not enter
   the binary. If OWL syntax parsing is needed beyond what the permissive crates
   give, it is written or found elsewhere.
3. **A reasoning algorithm may be adopted; the scan may not.** Epics 6, 95, 98
   evaluate `reasonable` and `whelk-rs` against the pattern above before writing
   an engine. **Epic 98 in particular should not start until `whelk-rs` has been
   evaluated** — an EL reasoner is weeks of work and a BSD-3 one already exists.
4. **Every adopted library gets a differential test against our own path**
   where both exist, and against a Python implementation where ours is the only
   Rust one. An external oracle cannot share a misunderstanding with the code
   under test, which is the entire value.
5. **Adoption is revisited when a library's licence changes.** `cargo deny` in
   CI enforces this rather than a reviewer remembering.

## What we build, and why it is not reinvention

After the above, what remains is genuinely this project's:

- **The flake store** — time-travelling and authorization-filterable. No library
  offers this shape.
- **Query evaluation over flakes** — the planner maps standard algebra onto four
  index orderings and a compiled access predicate. The algebra is adopted; the
  mapping cannot be.
- **Derivation chains** — the explanation contract.
- **Budget enforcement** — every operation bounded, truncation reported. No
  surveyed library bounds anything.

That is a much smaller list than "a SPARQL engine, a reasoner and an RDF layer",
and stating it is the point of this document.
